# Automated Scaling Solution for Web Application on AWS

This repository contains an implemented automated scaling solution for a web application hosted on AWS. The solution ensures efficient management of fluctuating traffic volumes by automatically adjusting the number of EC2 instances based on load conditions.

## Features

- **Automated Scaling**: The application dynamically scales EC2 instances up or down based on traffic load, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- **High Availability**: By adjusting resources dynamically, the application maintains high availability and responsiveness, even during traffic spikes.
- **Integration with AWS Services**: Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, and Elastic Load Balancing, the solution seamlessly integrates with AWS infrastructure.

## Architecture

1. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring efficient load balancing.
2. **Auto Scaling Group**: Monitors the EC2 instances and automatically adjusts their numbers based on predefined policies and CloudWatch metrics.
3. **CloudWatch**: Collects and tracks performance metrics, allowing for proactive scaling decisions based on real-time data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured on the local machine
- Familiarity with AWS services (EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Configure Launch Configuration**:
   - Define the AMI, instance type, security groups, and other configurations for the EC2 instances.
   - Use AWS CLI to create the launch configuration.

2. **Create Auto Scaling Group**:
   - Define the desired capacity, minimum and maximum size of the group.
   - Attach the load balancer to the Auto Scaling group for distributing traffic.
   - Set up scaling policies based on CloudWatch alarms.

3. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Create alarms to monitor key performance metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, etc.
   - Define thresholds and actions to be taken when thresholds are breached.

4. **Testing and Monitoring**:
   - Validate the setup by generating varying levels of traffic to the application.
   - Monitor CloudWatch metrics and Auto Scaling activities to ensure proper scaling behavior.

## Conclusion

With this automated scaling solution in place, the web application can effectively handle varying levels of traffic while optimizing resource usage and ensuring high availability. By leveraging AWS Auto Scaling and CloudWatch, the application infrastructure can dynamically adapt to changing demand, providing a seamless user experience.
